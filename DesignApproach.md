#Website Design Approach
This project will be made in collaboration between 4-5 team members at NiceWrk LLC. Using React.js, we will divide the work on a component basis and communicate internal issues, ideas, plans, and progress reports using https://www.notion.so/

##Task Organization and Delegation
Website Skeleton
Create a website skeleton such that it is component based and easy to recognize different sections of the website.

##Pages
These are the main sections of the website and currently include: Home, Amenities, About, Home Types, Surrounding Areas, and Contact/Maintenance Requests.

##Navbar
The navigation bar will appear to be floating along with the website user and will provide shortcut links to the different pages. This navbar should be able to adapt to desktop and mobile users.

##Forms
The forms for maintenance and home improvement requests will be found here. The forms will be adapted to be in their appropriate designated page.
