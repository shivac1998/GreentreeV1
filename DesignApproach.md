# Website Design Approach

This project will be made in collaboration between 4-5 team members at NiceWrk LLC. Using React.js, we will divide the work on a component basis and communicate internal issues, ideas, plans, and progress reports using https://www.notion.so/

## Task Organization and Delegation

### Website Skeleton
Create a website skeleton such that it is component based and easy to recognize different sections of the website. This will have separate folders within the src directory that focus on specific features of the website.

### Pages
These are the main sections of the website and currently include: Home, Amenities, About, Home Types, Surrounding Areas, Architecture, and Contact/Maintenance Requests.

### Forms
The forms for maintenance and home improvement requests will be found here. The forms will be adapted to be in their appropriate designated page.

### Navbar

The navigation bar will appear to be floating along with the website user and will provide shortcut links to the different webpages. This navbar should be able to adapt to desktop and mobile users.


### Layout

The Layout section will contain styling features for all navigation.

### UI

The UI section will contain styling features for the overall website features.
